Description:
    FSGL - Flexible Semi-Graphics Library

    This library provides all the nessicary tools for constructing a 
    higher level graphics library using low level semi-graphic raster 
    functionality.

    Provides a set of classes and interfaces for directly performing
    2D semi-graphic operations.

Features:
    2D Semi-Graphics (Text Graphics)
        A raster graphics like system that relies on unicode characters
        for individual cells.

        There should be the ability to write 2D buffers of 'cells' to
        other 2D buffers and to the Screen through the GPU.
    
    Blending
        The procedure to writing the 'cells' should allow combinding the
        source and destination 'cells' in a custom manner. This is called
        blending and should be modular.

        This is done at write.

    Shading
        The ability to process 'cells' of a 2D buffer to cause certain
        effects to appear is called Shading and should be modular.

        This is done at write.

    Color
        Common color, either mono, 16, or 256 depening on support.

    Cell
        Contains a character, foreground, and background. Represents a
        terminal cell.

    Mosaic
        2D buffer of Cells.

    Blender
        Blends two Cells togther, source and destination, to form a new
        Cell.

    Shader
        Shades a Cell of a Mosaic to create a new Cell.

    Target
        Defines a universal interface for blitting
    TargetScreen
        Implementation of RenderTarget for a Screen.
    TargetMosaic
        Implementation of RenderTarget for a Mosaic.
